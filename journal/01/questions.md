# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > It allows for easy access and collaboration on code, shows how active we are as developers, and saves projects to the cloud so they can be worked on across different devices.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is used to style a specific part of an element. I think we will use root, hover, and active quite a bit.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity determines which rule to apply in css when there are multiple rules. It is beneficial when using multiple rules are trageting an element and property but assigning different values.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Overusing !important could cause problems with specificity and make code not run correctly as it will overwrite css styling rules.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > selector{
        property: value
    }

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design makes a website more readable and attractive, making people more likely to spend time exploring it. Design can be used to convey the theme or content of the website.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > It gives us a full outline of the webpage detailing structure, layout, info, and functionality.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes, I think it's very helpful to have some sort of guide or template to reference. It saves time and minimizes time spent on design choices when building.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Sets the display of an html element as a flex container.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Width and height
