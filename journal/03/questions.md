# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > The four pillars of OOP's are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > Export default is used to export a single value while export is used to export multiple named values from a module

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > The bundling of data and the methods that act upon that data. Data is stored privately and only the methods that act on it have access it the data.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > Proxy objects can be used in place of the original object, and can redefine fundamental operations for that object

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?

  >A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An instance of a class is an object created using that class.

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > A property that can be used to modify, manipulate, and display data within your components in a readable and efficient manner.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > Organization, to write predictable maintainable code that can be scaled and expanded without the risk of breaking legacy features.

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > Handles user input and updates the view based on changes in the model.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > The service changes data stored within the appstate

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > The model stores the core information that your application is being used to access and manipulate.
