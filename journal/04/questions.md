# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Aysnchronous code happens in the background, and awaits responses before continuing to run. Used to interact with apis. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener can target something stored in the appstate and call a funtion when that value changes using on and emit.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > Representational State Transfer. It means that an application exposes information about itself through information about its resources, and a clien can take action on those resources.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > It is a convention for a function that does not immediately return something. It takes some time for it to produce a result.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise is an object that will either be resolved or get rejected when the time comes. Use try catch to catch an error from a promise.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > .get, .post .delete

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > async

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > It is used to bundle data and methods, hiding and protecting data and keeps it from being modified by unauthorized users.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Bad request
